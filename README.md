In this project, I have created a class that trains a 3 layers neural network model and returns the predictions. I will then use this class to predict the species of iris flowers from data with the following features:

* `sepal_length` - Continuous variable measured in centimeters.
* `sepal_width` - Continuous variable measured in centimeters.
* `petal_length` - Continuous variable measured in centimeters.
* `petal_width` - Continuous variable measured in centimeters.
* `species` - Categorical. 2 species of iris flowers, Iris-virginica or Iris-versicolor.
